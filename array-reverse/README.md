# Reverse an Array

Use a whiteboard process to illustrate the problem of reversing an input array.

## Approach & Efficiency

I followed through with the steps we learned in class, beginning with the problem statement. From there I went to the input/output and then a visualization of what the function should look like from a more abstract perspective. It was pseudocode from there until I was ready to write the code itself. I checked my work in replit and illustrated the walkthrough.

My focus was on following the process that we used in class, and I used the lecture/demo we did with David as reference.
