# Code Challenge 07

## Singly Linked List

I created a linked list using an ES6 Class in TypeScript. This singly linked list contains node that have an item and pointer to the next node. It is a singly linked list, because you can only traverse forward through the list. This was accomplished using a while loop and checking that the values weren't null (signifying the end of the list)

## Challenge

Add k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

This was a fun challenge. Efficiency on my functionality will be added in the future, but my code does have to traverse the linked list twice, which is not as efficient as it could be.
