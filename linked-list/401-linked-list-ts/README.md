# Code Challenge 07

## Singly Linked List

I created a linked list using an ES6 Class in TypeScript. This singly linked list contains node that have an item and pointer to the next node. It is a singly linked list, because you can only traverse forward through the list. This was accomplished using a while loop and checking that the values weren't null (signifying the end of the list)

## Challenge

Add k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

This was really a brain twister. I relied on help from my collaborators. It makes sense as I worked through it, but writing it out on a sheet of paper (modeling it) was very beneficial.
