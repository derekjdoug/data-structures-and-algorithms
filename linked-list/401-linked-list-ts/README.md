# Code Challenge 10

## Singly Linked List

I created a linked list using an ES6 Class in TypeScript. This singly linked list contains node that have an item and pointer to the next node. It is a singly linked list, because you can only traverse forward through the list. This was accomplished using a while loop and checking that the values weren't null (signifying the end of the list)

## Challenge

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency

This was a fun challenge. I leaned on some of the prior code that I had written and adapted it for stacks and queues.
