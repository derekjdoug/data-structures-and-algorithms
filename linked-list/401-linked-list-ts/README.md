# Singly Linked List

I created a linked list using an ES6 Class in TypeScript. This singly linked list contains node that have an item and pointer to the next node. It is a singly linked list, because you can only traverse forward through the list. This was accomplished using a while loop and checking that the values weren't null (signifying the end of the list)

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value store in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Approach & Efficiency

We worked through this together in class. I believe that singly linked lists are O(n).

## API
