# Binary Search

Write a function called *BinarySearch* which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

This was fairly straight forward until we got to the actual coding part. We were pretty close to the answer with our original logic, but needed a little push to get over the edge. We needed to adjust how we were shifting our new midpoints based on previous iterations through the while loop. I was proud of myself for hitting on some of the math ideas, while Hugo had the concept for the solution very, very close right from the beginning.
